# ByaHero! - Filipino Commuter's Guide Web Application

ByaHero! is a forum-like platform designed to connect Filipino commuters and build a supportive community where users can help each other navigate daily commuting challenges. Inspired by Reddit and Twitter/X, the platform empowers users to share experiences, post updates, and provide guidance through a tagging system that organizes content by routes, transportation types, and locations.

## Motivation

Commuting in the Philippines is often challenging and frustrating, especially for those unfamiliar with specific routes or transportation options. Many commuters struggle with:

- Not knowing where to board public transportation
- Confusion about which vehicles to take for specific destinations
- Difficulty navigating unfamiliar areas
- Limited access to accurate, up-to-date route information
- Unreliable or hard-to-understand route maps and apps

While general social media platforms provide some advice, they lack a dedicated space where commuters can comfortably ask questions and share experiences focused on transportation needs.

ByaHero! was created to fill the gap between general social media and specialized transportation apps by providing a dedicated community platform where accurate, real-time transportation advice can be shared in a user-friendly format. I aim to build a supportive community that helps alleviate the daily stress and confusion of commuting in the Philippines.
